Hi! My name is Luunahri and I'm a 18 year old coding beginner, I've been passionate about coding for about a year now. In my free time I do my own personal coding involvong databases, I like playing around in those. I've been the top of my class in terms of coding ever since we began learning about it, I've always exceeded the expectations of my teacher and rarely ever failed. In my most desperate times I tend to ask AI based apps like ChatGPT or Codium for help with bits of code.
